# TinyGo: Getting the upper hen üêì

## Abstract

TinyGo is a Go compiler for small places such as microcontroller or web. Join Donia for a demo and see live henhouse 
temperature and humidity data displayed on dashboards.

Starting from a basic understanding of what TinyGo is, you will learn how to:

- Use the appropriate driver for your hardware
- Retrieve data from a thermometer and humidity captor
- Communicate with your microcontroller using WiFi
- Build a dashboard with temperature and humidity data
- Check that your hens are doing well, from your couch

And, if you still do not want to adopt chickens, you can let your creativity flow by building your own project, using our favorite language.

Talk/Attendee Level: All Attendees
